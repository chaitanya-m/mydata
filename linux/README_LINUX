MyData for Linux

The Linux binary (.tar.gz) distribution of MyData doesn't require any
installation. After extracting, the "mydata" binary file can be run using:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./mydata

If you wish to run MyData using an icon on your desktop, or using a
menu item, you will need to copy the "MyData.desktop" file to your 
~/Desktop/ and adjust the executable and icon paths specified in 
"MyData.desktop" to wherever you choose to install MyData, 
(/opt/MyData/ is recommended). If using a custom installation 
directory, you will need to update the LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in the 
mydata/mydata.sh wrapper script.

If you want to make MyData accessible for all users, you can copy
"MASSIVE Launcher.desktop" to /usr/share/applications/ and copy the icon files
from MasiveLauncher/icons/ into appropriate subdirectories within 
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/
