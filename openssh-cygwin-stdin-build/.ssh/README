Dummy file so that we can keep the .ssh directory in git.
The Cygwin OpenSSH would normally try to create the .ssh directory in the
user's home directory, but because we don't have user home directories set
up within our minimal Cygwin environment bundled with MyData, Cygwin's
OpenSSH might try to create a "known_hosts" file in this directory.
Therefore, we need to ensure that this directory is writeable.
