To profile MyData, yappi is recommended:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yappi

Make the following patch (#1) to mydata/MyData.py:

At the end of the "OnCloseFrame" method, add event.Skip(), which will allow
the EVT_CLOSE event to propagate to the point where wxPython knows that all
of its top level windows have been closed, so it can end its main loop without
exiting out of the Python shell.

Then run the following:

import yappi
from mydata import MyData
yappi.start()
MyData.Run(argv=[''])
# Interact with MyData's GUI, open its main window,
# and run time-consuming tasks. Then close MyData's
# main window, having made patch #1
yappi.get_func_stats().print_all()
yappi.get_thread_stats().print_all()

The task bar icon / system tray menu will not be destroyed by patch #1, but
after closing the main window (and stopping the event loop), it will not
be usable.  It will disappear when you exit from the Python shell.  If this
bothers you, you could add self.taskBarIcon.Destroy() to Patch #1.

To re-run profiling, exit and relaunch Python before re-running yappi and
MyData.
